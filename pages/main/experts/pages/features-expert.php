   <p>Expert Select is <b>free</b> for all Medical Experts and can be used to easily book and keep track of your appointments. You will be able to book appointments directly into your diaries instead of wasting time on the telephone and emailing to confirm an appointment. </p>
  <p>This booking system notifies all relevant parties; so when a Medical Expert books an appointment, this is then made available to book through the MRO waiting room page. Once this appointment has been booked by the MRO, the Medical Expert is informed that the appointment has been booked and the Patient gets notified with the Medical Expert details and the venue details. You are also able to generate a Medical Report which is then saved to your documents page</p>
  <p>Once logged in, Experts can:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Manage Appointments</li>
    <li>Venue Management</li>
    <li>Keep track of notifications</li>
    	 <ul>
        	<li>Messages</li>
            <li>Cancellations</li>
            <li>Appointment Requests</li>
            <li>Appointment Updates</li>
            <li>Aggrement Enquires</li>
            <li>Archived</li>
         </ul>
    	<li>Upload Documents</li>
   		<li>Medical Report Generation</li>
    	<li>Manage MRO agreements</li>
    	<li>Search for Appointments created by MRO's or a specific MRO</li>
    </ul>
  
  <p>Even though this is <b>free</b>, we <b>don't</b> restrict any features and we don't limit how many appointments and venues that are made.</p>
