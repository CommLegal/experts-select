   <p>Expert Select is <b>free</b> for all MRO's and can be used to easily book and keep track of your appointments. You will be able to book appointments directly into your diaries instead of wasting time on the telephone and emailing to confirm an appointment. </p>
  <p>This booking system notifies all relevant parties; so when a Medical Expert books an appointment, this is then made available to book through the MRO waiting room page. Once this appointment has been booked by the MRO, the Medical Expert is informed that the appointment has been booked and the patients gets notified with the expert and venue details. You are able to create users for your organisation and you can change their permission level, which grants them access to particular pages on your account.</p>
  <p>Once logged in, MRO's can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create users</li>
    <li>Keep track of notifications</li>
    	<ul>
        	<li>Messages</li>
            <li>Cancellations</li>
            <li>Appointment Requests</li>
            <li>Appointment Updates</li>
            <li>Appointment Enquiries</li>
            <li>Archived</li>
      	</ul>
  	<li>Edit your profile</li>
  	<li>Manage Appointments</li>
    <li>Manage Expert agreements</li>
    <li>Search for Appointments created by Medical Expert's or a particular Medical Expert</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Even though this system is <b>free</b>, we <b>don't</b> restrict any features and we don't limit how many users and agreements are made.</p>
